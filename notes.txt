RUN GAME SERVER IN SUDO BECAUSE IT LISTENS ON PORT 80 (e.g. io1 go debug, io1 run)

WHEN DEPLOYING:
	- Compile game (with debug mode)
	- Deploy game binary
	- DEPLOY STATIC FILES
    - MANUALLY CHANGE VERSION FOR PARTY LINKS IN LOADER3.JS

REMEMBER TO UPLOAD SERVERLIST.JS WHEN UPDATING BALANCER
CORS NOT WORKING?

To do:
	- Mobile preroll not centered
	- Don't show an interstitial every time in the app
	- Show stats at end of game
	- Upgrade/delete shortcuts
	- Bomb Unit
	- Tip scaling
	- If you press repetitively the button that appears below that gives you the menu of cells and parts that you can acquire (either the one on the left or the one on the right) and then you release it, it will continue to be pressed and you will not be able to manage the menu.
	- Actually remove booster unit
	- Party: proper player counter / ad consent / actual versionElement
	- Battle royale mode
	- Reward resources for build units too

Battle royale:
	- Remove waiting for x players message when switching to ffa
	- # FIX TOTAL JOINED
	- Shapes destroyed at edge
	- # Map feels empty
	- # Doesn't always show "Victory royale!"

Ideas:
	- Bomb Unit
	- Battle royale mode

Description:
    - When a player visits the page, they are prompted to enter a nickname. Then, they click the play button. This enters them into a large arena, in which they can move around. They start of by clicking to fire bullets at floaters (small triangles). These floaters, upon being destroyed, give the player an amount of resource of its own type. Better resource floaters are harder to destroy, but those resources can be used to buy better units. These units can be bought and added onto the craft, attached to the only unit to start of with: the core. In this way, they can build their ship, and then battle other players. If they are ranked in the top 10, they appear on the leaderboard which all players in the arena can see. When their units are dealt damage (by bullets or collision), they lose health. If a unit gets to 0 health, it gets destroyed. They player is out of the game once their core unit is destroyed, but can respawn from scratch after being eliminated.
